To extend zulip to enable chatting-with-customers features. 

* One extra view was added to expose limited chat UI to customer ~views/support.py~.
* List of Support accounts which would be mapped with customer are part of ~views/zulip-support.py~
* For routing two urls are to be added to current ~zproject/urls.py~ which are in ~urls.py~
* To prevent customers from accessing email ids of complete realm we tweaked ~get_status_dict~ in zerver/libs/actions.py
#+BEGIN_SRC code
    # Return no status info for regular users
    if requesting_user_profile.realm.domain != settings.ADMIN_DOMAIN:
        return defaultdict(dict)
#+END_SRC
* Similar check was added to ~views/__init__.py~ home function to redirect customer to support interface.
* These htmls could be rendered inside an iframe on your home page to give you a private, self hosted chat-with-us plugin for your site.
